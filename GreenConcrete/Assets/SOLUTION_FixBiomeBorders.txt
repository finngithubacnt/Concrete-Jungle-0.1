║         SOLUTION: FIX DISCONNECTED BIOME BORDERS             ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

THE PROBLEM
-----------
Your biome borders looked messy and disconnected because:

1. Biome radii were WAY too small - All biomes had radiusInTiles = 1 
2. With 18 biome centers spread across your world, biomes were tiny dots
3. The blend width (8 tiles) was actually LARGER than the biomes themselves!
4. This caused constant overlapping and chaotic transitions


THE SOLUTION - QUICK FIX (DO THIS NOW!)
----------------------------------------

In Unity's top menu, go to:
>>> Tools → Quick Fix: Update All Biome Settings <<<

Click "Yes, Fix It"

This will automatically:
  ✓ Set all biome radii to 15 tiles (proper size)
  ✓ Configure BiomeManager with optimal settings
  ✓ Regenerate biome centers

Then ENTER PLAY MODE to see the fixed biome borders!


MANUAL FIX (Alternative)
-------------------------

Option A: Use the Radius Fixer Tool
1. Go to Tools → Fix Biome Radii
2. Set "New Radius" to 15-20 tiles
3. Click "Fix All Biome Radii"
4. Select your BiomeManager GameObject
5. Click "Regenerate Biome Centers" button
6. Enter Play mode

Option B: Fix Each Biome Manually
1. In Project window, go to /Assets/layers/
2. Select each BiomeDefinition asset (Forest, GrassLands, City, etc.)
3. In Inspector, change "Radius In Tiles" from 1 to 15
4. Repeat for all biomes
5. Select BiomeManager in Hierarchy
6. Right-click component → "Regenerate Biome Centers"
7. Enter Play mode


WHAT WAS WRONG?
---------------

BEFORE (BAD):
  Biome Radius: 1 tile
  World Extent: 10 tiles (20 tile wide world)
  Center Count: 18 biomes
  Result: Tiny biomes, constant overlapping, messy borders

AFTER (GOOD):
  Biome Radius: 15 tiles
  World Extent: 10 tiles (20 tile wide world)  
  Center Count: 18 biomes
  Result: Proper-sized biomes, smooth transitions, connected regions


EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX
---------------------------

You should see:
  ✅ Smooth transitions between biomes (no hard edges)
  ✅ Connected regions - biomes form coherent areas
  ✅ Natural-looking borders - organic, flowing boundaries
  ✅ Proper blending - textures blend smoothly across tiles
  ✅ Stable biomes - clear biome zones with transition areas


ADDITIONAL TOOLS AVAILABLE

BiomeManager Inspector Now Has Preset Buttons:
  • Natural Landscape - Best for realistic worlds
  • Stylized - Game-y, artistic look
  • Sharp Borders - Clear, distinct biomes  
  • Performance - Optimized settings

Debug Visualization:
  • Show Debug Gizmos - See biome centers and radii
  • Show Border Debug - Visualize transition zones
  • Yellow wireframes = blend zones
  • Colored cubes = biome dominance


FINE-TUNING AFTER FIX
---------------------

If Biomes Are Too Large:
  → Reduce "Radius In Tiles" to 10-12
  → Increase "Center Count" to 25-30

If Biomes Are Too Small:
  → Increase "Radius In Tiles" to 18-20
  → Reduce "Center Count" to 12-15

If Transitions Are Too Abrupt:
  → Increase "Biome Blend Width" to 10-12
  → Increase "Neighbor Lookups" to 4-5
  → Ensure "Use Per Pixel Blending" is ON

If Transitions Are Too Gradual:
  → Decrease "Biome Blend Width" to 4-6
  → Reduce "Border Noise Amplitude" to 3-4


WHY RADIUS MATTERS
------------------

The biome radius controls how large each biome region is:

  Too Small (1-5 tiles):  Biomes are tiny dots, constant blending
  Too Large (30+ tiles):  Few transitions, monotonous world
  Just Right (10-20):     Clear biome zones with smooth transitions

Recommended Formula:
  World Extent × 2 / √(Center Count) ≈ Minimum Radius

  Your setup: 10 × 2 / √18 = 4.7 tiles minimum
  So use: 10-20 tiles for good coverage


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

"Biomes still look disconnected"
  → Ensure "Use Connected Regions" is enabled in BiomeManager
  → Run: Tools → Quick Fix: Reset Biome Centers Only
  → Check that biome definitions have terrain layers assigned

"Textures don't blend"
  → Ensure "Use Per Pixel Blending" is ON in BiomeManager
  → Verify terrain layers are assigned in BiomeDefinition assets
  → Check that biomes have different textures

"Performance is slow"
  → Disable "Use Per Pixel Blending"
  → Reduce "Border Noise Octaves" to 1-2
  → Reduce "Neighbor Lookups" to 2
  → Or click the "Performance" preset button

"Changes don't appear"
  → Always regenerate biome centers after changing settings
  → Exit and re-enter Play mode
  → Check Console for any errors


QUICK SUMMARY
-------------

The core issue: biome radius = 1 tile (way too small!)

The fix:
  1. Run: Tools → Quick Fix: Update All Biome Settings
  2. Enter Play mode
  3. Enjoy smooth, connected biome borders! 🎉

That's it! Your biomes will now look natural and connected.
