EDGE BLENDING - UPDATED IMPLEMENTATION
======================================

CHANGES APPLIED:
---------------

1. REMOVED edge blending from GenerateTerrainHeights()
   - Edge blending no longer happens during initial terrain generation
   - Base terrain heights are now generated without blending

2. CREATED new ApplyEdgeBlending() method
   - Dedicated method that runs AFTER all terrain modifications
   - Blends edges between neighboring active tiles only
   - Updates both current tile and neighboring tiles simultaneously
   - Saves blended heights to persistence system

3. UPDATED UpdateTerrainGrid() execution order
   - Step 1: Create terrain tile with base heights
   - Step 2: Apply biome height modifications (if enabled)
   - Step 3: Apply biome texture painting
   - Step 4: Spawn tile prefabs (if enabled)
   - Step 5: Apply edge blending to newly created tiles ← NEW!

EXECUTION ORDER (Per Tile):
---------------------------

1. CreateOrLoadTile()
   └─ GenerateTerrainHeights() - Base noise generation only

2. ApplyBiomeHeightModification() [BiomeManager]
   └─ Applies height multipliers, offsets, curves, and biome-specific noise

3. ApplyBiomeEffects() [BiomeManager]
   └─ Paints terrain textures based on biome influences

4. SpawnTilePrefab() [BiomeManager]
   └─ Spawns optional prefabs on tile

5. ApplyEdgeBlending() ← Runs LAST
   └─ Seamlessly blends edges with neighboring tiles
   └─ Updates both tiles and saves to persistence

WHY THIS WORKS BETTER:
----------------------

BEFORE:
- Edge blending happened during base generation
- Biome modifications applied after blending
- Result: Visible seams between tiles with different biome heights

AFTER:
- All biome modifications complete first
- Edge blending applies to final terrain state
- Result: Smooth transitions even with different biome heights

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
-----------------

- Blending only occurs with active (loaded) neighboring tiles
- Blend width controlled by 'blendWidth' parameter (default: 5)
- Uses Lerp interpolation for smooth height transitions
- Both tiles update simultaneously to ensure perfect alignment
- Changes saved to savedHeights dictionary for persistence

SETTINGS:
--------

In DynamicPersistentTerrain component:
- blendWidth (Range -50 to 50): Number of edge pixels to blend
  - Recommended: 3-10 for smooth transitions
  - Higher values = smoother but more blending area
  - Lower values = sharper transitions

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
-----------------

- Edge blending runs once per newly created tile
- Only blends with active neighbors (not saved/unloaded tiles)
- Minimal performance impact due to efficient implementation
- Blending updates are saved for consistency when tiles reload

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------

Q: I still see seams between tiles
A: Increase blendWidth to 8-10 for smoother transitions

Q: Edges look too smooth/blurred
A: Decrease blendWidth to 3-5 for sharper biome boundaries

Q: Performance issues when loading tiles
A: Disable 'applyBiomeHeightModifications' temporarily to isolate

Q: Terrain heights don't persist correctly
A: Edge blending saves to savedHeights automatically - check SaveTileData()
